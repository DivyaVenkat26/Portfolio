# Call Centre Analytics Dashboard

## Project Overview  
This Excel dashboard analyzes call centre performance by integrating two datasets—Calls and Customers—using Power Query, 
Power Pivot, and Pivot Charts. The dashboard reveals trends in call volume, agent performance, sales conversion, and customer demographics.

## Objective & Process

### 1. Data Preparation & Modeling
- Imported two tables: *Calls* (with timestamp, duration, purchase, rating, agent) and *Customers* (with demographics).
- Cleaned the data by removing duplicates and checking data types.
- Connected both datasets via *Customer ID* using Power Pivot.

### 2. Pivot Table Metrics
- Extracted insights with Pivot Tables, including:
  - Call counts by month and day of week
  - Calls and revenue by representative
  - Average satisfaction and 5‑star ratings
  - Customer demographics breakdown (city and gender)
- Computed summary values: Total Calls, Total Purchase Amount, Average Rating, 5-Star Calls, and Total Duration.

### 3. Dashboard Design
- Built interactive Pivot Charts to visualize metrics.
- Included slicers to filter by representative, updating all charts and KPI cards simultaneously.
- KPI cards display summary values across key metrics.
